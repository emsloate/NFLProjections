# NFLProjections

Reddit post on r/nfl here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/939g5s/marcel_for_the_nfl_creating_a_simple_projection/

Projection_Model.ipynb will generate projections given csv data, which can be generated from the scripts in the web scraping folder. This takes a long time and doesn't work for all players (birthdate data can be missing frequently), but the data is already in the /Data folder, and the projections are in /Projections. /Pictures contains some interesting information about the projections and aging curve.
